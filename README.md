I didn't insert any viruses into autoit, I have no idea, but probably such a misunderstanding can happen [here](https://github.com/vboxme/Portable-VirtualBox/issues/93).<br>
If you downloaded something from here, if you don't trust it, you can delete it, decide for yourself.<br>
I have drawn conclusions and am finishing making changes to portable virtualbox.<br>
