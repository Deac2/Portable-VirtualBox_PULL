Virustotal shows Dropped Files:<br>
JAVASCRIPT Because of the text that autoit compiles automatically: is an invalid data character in JavaScript compatibility mode different names for subpatterns of the same number are not allowed (*MARK) must have an argument this version of PCRE is not compiled with Unicode property support<br>
Mark as: +1 Trellix (ENS) Artemis!979ED69F8C86 Acronis (Static ML) Undetected<br>
All virustotal marks on autoit are not always real<br>

I didn't insert any viruses into autoit, I have no idea, but probably such a misunderstanding can happen [here](https://github.com/vboxme/Portable-VirtualBox/issues/93).<br>
If you downloaded something from here, if you don't trust it, you can delete it, decide for yourself.<br>
I have drawn conclusions and am finishing making changes to portable virtualbox.<br>
